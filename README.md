# Xylophone-App
Xylophone App practice and all layout provided by Angela Yu.

#This is my second challenge here in GitHub. I'm practicing the functionality of adding buttons and sound to work together, along with multiple IBAction
selection and utilizing fuctions with parameters and arguments.

CHALLENGE ACOMPLISHED: 

º Figure out how to use code to change the opacity of the button that was pressed so that when you press a button on the Xylophone app, it will dim to half the original opacity.

º Next, figure out how to delay code execution by 0.2 seconds, so that when you press on one of the Xylophone buttons your code immediately print “Start” and then prints “End” after 0.2 seconds.

º Finally, put it all together to achieve a goal. The goal is to dim the button that was pressed by 0.2 seconds and then make it go back to its original opacity to achieve the effect of an animated button press.
